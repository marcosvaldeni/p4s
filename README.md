# :handbag: Layout

The P4S layout was based on an exercise proposed by the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh) website, all the improvements made to the original layout and the creation of the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/cmESjz6jCIXs7oJRnsFGmq/P4S?node-id=0%3A1) were made by [Marcos Lucas](https://github.com/marcosvaldeni).
Please, feel free to access the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/cmESjz6jCIXs7oJRnsFGmq/P4S?node-id=0%3A1), clone it, and use it as you like.
